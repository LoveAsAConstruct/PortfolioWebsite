                    <h2><strong>Project Overview</strong></h2>
                    <p>The Kroka Collaboration was a project focusing on the designing of multiple installations for the organization Kroka Explorations, a wilderness survival school over 100 miles away from NuVu. I pursued the creation and design of three solutions to problems ranging from boat lifting systems to drying firewood with solar kilns. Later on, our team made a series of excursions ranging up to multiple days to install our prototypes on the Kroka campus. Through the three weeks that we spent collaborating with Kroka, we installed a 7:1 pulley system that vastly increased the efficiency of their boat lifting system, a rocket stove capable of boiling waters on multiple burners, and schematics for a 24-cord bandwidth solar kiln.</p>

                    <h2><strong>My Contributions</strong></h2>
                    <p>Through this project, I worked with a number of my teammates to deliver three design solutions to various elements of the Kroka wilderness school's campus, we designed and implemented a pulley system for lifting boats and a rocket stove capable of boiling water on multiple burners. We also were able to produce schematics of a solar kiln capable of processing two cords of wood a month.</p>

                    <h2>Reflections</h2>
                    <p>This project was incredibly beneficial, and I feel I strengthened my technical and conceptual skills considerably. This project contained many points of growth and firsts for us students and NuVu as a whole. My experience was notably beneficial in terms of growth through working on client interaction, project scope, and time management. I also greatly valued the experience of integration into the Kroka community and loved the time I spent on campus. Further, the hands-off coaching technique our coach employed greatly improved my learning experience with client interaction like no other system. The ability to learn by failure and persevere through hard problems was an incredibly effective learning method that greatly reinforced my project management skills.</p>
